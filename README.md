# Tet-rs

## What is this project?

Tet-rs is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game in Rust, played in the terminal.

## Project Background

I started this as a weekend project to improve my Rust skills and create a fun, nostalgic game.
Recently I realized most of my Rust activities were at work and mostly only for web app or
data-services related; I kinda miss making things like this. Especially after
[go-dinorun](https://github.com/ahmad-alkadri/go-dinorun),
I realized I have special place in my heart for simple terminal-based game.

## Project Goals

I know there are a lot of other Tetris games for the terminal out there; my goal is to make something 
as simple as possible with minimal external crates.

## Project Status

The whole thing is still ongoing. Graphics not even polished at all yet. Current screenshot:
